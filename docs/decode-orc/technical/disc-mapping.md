# Disc Mapping Design

This document describes a robust, deterministic design for reconstructing a
frame-accurate disc map from a noisy field capture in ld-decode. The design
explicitly prioritizes VBI-derived picture numbering (CAV / CLV), uses field
phase only as a rejection and tie-breaking mechanism, and cleanly separates
field pairing from frame numbering and gap detection.

---

## 1. Problem Summary

Input is a sequential capture of *fields* that may be:
- Missing, duplicated, reordered, or corrupted
- Carrying inconsistent or missing VBI data
- Affected by noise, dropouts, or capture glitches

Goal:
- Reconstruct an ordered sequence of *frames*
- Assign each frame a picture number (if possible)
- Detect and pad missing frames
- Choose the best instance among duplicates
- Preserve correct absolute positioning on the disc timeline

---

## 2. Definitions

### Field
A captured video field with:
- `FieldID` (capture order; not guaranteed contiguous)
- Parity (first / second field; may be unreliable)
- Phase hint (NTSC 1–4, PAL 1–8)
- Per-field VBI data (CAV PN, CLV timecode, chapter/program)
- Quality metrics

### Frame
A logical pairing of two related fields representing one picture on disc.

### Picture Number (PN)
A monotonically increasing integer index:
- CAV: directly from VBI picture number
- CLV: derived from timecode using format FPS
- `PN == 0` is invalid (lead-in/out)

---

## 3. Source-of-Truth Priority

1. **CAV picture number**
2. **CLV timecode → picture number**
3. Chapter / program number (weak hint only)
4. FieldID order, cadence, phase (supporting evidence only)

Phase and cadence must **never override valid VBI numbering**.

---

## 5. Per-Field Metadata Normalization

For each field:

1. Attempt to decode:
   - CAV picture number
   - CLV timecode → picture number
2. Validate:
   - PN ≠ 0
   - CRC / structural sanity
3. Assign confidence score
4. Mark lead-in/out or invalid data

All picture numbers are normalized to a single integer PN space.

---

## 6. Field Pairing (Candidate Frame Generation)

### 6.1 Pairing Strategy

- Fields are paired based on capture order (`FieldID`)
- Only pair within a small sliding window
- Prefer first → second parity but allow uncertainty

### 6.2 Frame Construction Rules

For each candidate pair:

- Select PN using priority:
  1. First field CAV PN
  2. Second field CAV PN
  3. First field CLV PN
  4. Second field CLV PN
- If both fields provide PN of same type:
  - Values must agree
  - Otherwise keep first-field value unless invalid
- Assign PN confidence
- Combine quality metrics
- Check phase consistency

### 6.3 Phase Handling

- Phase is used **only to veto obviously bad frames**
- Phase must not override trusted VBI PN
- Phase disagreement is recorded for later tie-breaking

Result: a set of candidate frames, some with PN, some without.

---

## 7. Frame Validation and Filtering

- Drop frames with PN == 0
- Retain frames with no PN for continuity
- Retain phase-invalid frames only if PN confidence is high
- Mark PN-disagreement and phase issues for later scoring

---

## 8. Deduplication and Frame Selection

### 8.1 Group by Picture Number

Frames with PN are grouped by PN value.

### 8.2 Duplicate Resolution

For each PN group, select the best frame using:

1. Highest PN confidence
2. Phase-valid preferred
3. Highest quality
4. Capture-order coherence with neighbors

All other frames for that PN are discarded.

---

## 9. Disc Timeline Construction

### 9.1 Ordered PN Sequence

- Sort selected frames by PN
- Enforce monotonic PN order
- Non-monotonic PN implies duplication or error

### 9.2 Gap Detection

For consecutive frames:

- If PN increments by 1 → OK
- If PN jumps forward:
  - Missing frames = ΔPN − 1
  - Insert PAD frames for missing PN values

Frames without PN:
- Do not block gap insertion
- Do not define numbering

---

## 10. PAD Frame Semantics

PAD frames represent missing frames on disc:
- Carry a PN
- Contain no image data
- Preserve absolute disc positioning
- Enable correct downstream indexing

---

## 11. Handling Regions with No VBI

When no trusted PN exists for a region:

- Do not invent PN
- Optionally estimate missing frames using:
  - FieldID gaps
  - Expected cadence (2 fields/frame)
  - Phase continuity
- Resume PN-driven mapping when VBI reappears

---

## 12. Consistency Checks

### CAV
- PN must strictly increment by 1
- Any repeat is a duplicate
- Any jump implies missing frames

### CLV
- PN must be monotonic
- Large absolute PN values are expected
- Conversion must be consistent with disc format

---

## 13. Algorithmic Components

| Stage                    | Technique                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Field pairing            | Sliding-window matching / min-cost  |
| Frame deduplication      | Deterministic scoring               |
| Gap detection            | PN monotone scan                    |
| Optional robustness      | Viterbi / HMM over PN               |

---

## 14. Design Principles

- VBI numbering defines ground truth
- Phase and cadence are supporting evidence only
- Field pairing is local; numbering is global
- Missing data is explicit (PAD), not implicit
- Prefer determinism over heuristics where possible

---

## 15. Outcome

This design produces:
- A stable, frame-accurate disc map
- Correct absolute picture numbering
- Explicit representation of missing content
- Robust behavior under severe capture corruption

---

## 16. Implementation

Each stage shall produce a clear description of the decision making process/pipeline - with each stage description becoming part of a report to be given to the user alongside that actual outcome (which will be a field map stage parameter (the field map list)).
